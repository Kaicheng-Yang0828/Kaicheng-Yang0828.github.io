In 2021, I earned my master's degree from Hebei University of Science and Technology. During 2018 to 2020, I had the opportunity to conduct research as a visiting student at Tsinghua University under the mentorship of Professor Hua Xu. My research interests include multimodal representation learning, vision-language pretraining, and contrastive learning.
