I‘m Kaicheng Yang, an algorithm researcher at DeepGlint. In 2021, I obtained my master’s degree from HeBei University of Science and Technology. From 2018 to 2020, I had the privilege of conducting scientific research as a visiting student at Tsinghua University under the guidance of Professor Hua Xu. My research focuses on multimodal learning, vision-language pretraining, and contrastive learning.
