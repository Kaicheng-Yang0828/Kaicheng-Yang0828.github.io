In 2021, I earned my master's degree from Hebei University of Science and Technology. During 2018 to 2020, I had the opportunity to conduct research as a visiting student at Tsinghua University under the mentorship of Professor Hua Xu. My research interests include multimodal representation learning, vision-language pretraining, and contrastive learning. 

**I'm actively hiring interns in the fields of multimodal representation learning, large-scale data cleaning, RAG, and Agent**. If you want to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact meðŸ˜Š.
